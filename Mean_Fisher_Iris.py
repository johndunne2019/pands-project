# Using the csv file saved in my repository to do some calculations
# Using the example from the lectures in week 9

import numpy  # imported the numpy module and given shorter name

data = numpy.genfromtxt('Fishers_Iris_data_set.csv',delimiter= ',', skip_header=1)
# numpy.genfromtxt is used to read the csv file 
# delimiter set as comma as data is separated on commas in csv files 
# skip_header used to skip the first row of data in the file, when i first wrote this script i was returned the value nan (not a number)
# I read about using skip_header here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.io.genfromtxt.html

sepal_lenght= data[:,0]
# variable sepal_lenght introduced and set equal to the first column of data

meansepal_lenght= numpy.mean(data[:,0])
# numpy.mean used to calculate the mean of the first column of data

print(f"The mean of the sepal lenght is: {meansepal_lenght} rounded to one decimal place {(round(meansepal_lenght, 1))}")
# The output has been set to return the mean of the first column of data and the mean rounded to one decimal place
# formatted string used to return the sentence when the program is run
