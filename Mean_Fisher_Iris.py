import numpy as np  # imported the numpy module and given shorter name np

data = np.genfromtxt('Fishers_Iris_data_set.csv',delimiter= ',', skip_header=1)
# numpy.genfromtxt is used to read the csv file 
# delimiter set as comma as data is separated on commas in csv files 
# skip_header used to skip the first row of data in the file, when i first wrote this script i was returned the value nan (not a number)
# I read about using skip_header here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.io.genfromtxt.html
# I read about genfromtxt here: https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.io.genfromtxt.html

# formatted string used to return the sentence when the program is run
# round function used to round the result to one decimal place
