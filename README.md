Ronald Fisher was born in 1890 and died in 1962 and is widely known by the title "father of statistics". He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest statisticians ever. Despite this, Fisher was primarily a Biologist and according to the author Richard Hawkins, he was the greatest biologist since Charles Darwin. 

**Interesting facts about Ronald Fisher**

* Ronald Fisher was born in London on February 17, 1890 and died in Adelaide, Australia on July 29, 1962. 
* Ronald suffered from shortsightedness and as a result was not allowed to read under an electric light. Despite this disability Ronald was widely acclaimed as a very bright student by his teachers and received scholarships for his education. 
* In 1909, Fisher was awarded a scholarship to study mathematics as the University of Cambridge and he graduated with a first class honours.
* Fisher had a keen interest in Eugenics which is the improvement of the human race by selective breeding. In 1911, he formed Cambridge University's Eugenics Society, which included amongst it's members Charles Darwin's son. The following is a quote from Fisher:

*"We can set no limit to human potentialities; all that is best in man can be bettered; it is not a question of producing a highly efficient machine, … but of quickening all the distinctly human features, all that is best in man, all the different qualities, some obvious, some infinitely subtle, which we recognize as humanly excellent"*

Quote from: https://www.famousscientists.org/ronald-fisher/

* Ronald volunteered for the British Army at the beginning of World War I but was rejected because of his poor sight. 
* He became a school teacher in 1914 teaching mathematics and physics. 
* He married Ruth Guinness in 1917 and they had 7 daughters and 2 sons together. Their eldest son George was killed in action in World War II in 1943. 
* In 1919 he became a statistician at Rothamsted Experimental Station which afforded him the opportunity to analyse data that had been collected as far back as 1842.
* In 1925, Fisher published a book "Statistical Methods for Research Workers" which went on to be widely acclaimed as a revolutionary piece of work on statistics and biology. 
* In 1935, Fisher released his book "The Design of Experiments" in which he introduced the concept of null hypothesis. 
* In 1952 Fisher was knighted by Queen Elizabeth becoming Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher. 
* In all, Fisher wrote 7 books and approximately 400 academic papers in the field of statistics. 

**Lady Tasting Tea**

Apart from the Fisher Iris data set Ronald Fisher is also famous for another problem set called Lady Tasting Tea. Fisher published the experiment in his book - The Design of Experiments.The experiment originated when a lady claimed to be able to tell simply from tasting a cup of tea whether the tea or the milk had been infused first. Fisher set about disproving this claim by designing the experiment which consisted of 8 cups of tea, 4 made with the tea infused first and 4 made with the milk infused first. 

## Introduction to the Fisher's Iris Data Set

The Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set that was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 in his paper - "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". The data set is also referred to as the Edgar Anderson data set as it was Edgar Anderson who collected the data. 

*"It is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify themorphologic variation of Iris ﬂowers of three related species."* - https://www.academia.edu/13069408/Report_on_Edgar_Anderson_s_Iris_Data_Analysis


**Contents of the Fisher's Iris Data Set**

There are 150 rows of data in the data set in total, each representing a species of Iris flower. There are 3 species in total with 50 rows of data on each species. 

* Iris Setosa
* Iris Versicolor
* Iris Virginica 

*"The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other." -  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

**Detailed below are the contents of each column of data in the data set:**

1. Column 1 contains sepal length in cm
2. Column 2 contains sepal width in cm
3. Column 3 contains petal length in cm
4. Column 4 contains petal width in cm
5. Column 5 contains the name of the species of Iris flower

The data set is available to view in my repository - "Fishers_Iris_data_set.csv"

**What is unique about the Fisher's Iris data set?**

The Fisher's Iris data set is a data set that is commonly used in machine learning. One very significant feature of the data set is that the data concerning two of the species of Iris flowers are easy to separate from one another whilst it is difficult to separate the data concerning the other two species of Iris flowers.

*"One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other."* - https://www.kaggle.com/meetsourav/clustering-with-iris-dataset

*Listed below are some of the noteworthy features of the Iris data set taken from: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/*

* Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.
* It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
* It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
* It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).
* All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.

**The Iris Flower**
 
The Iris flower is a perennial flower meaning it lives longer than two years and the flower is notably easy to grow. 

**Iris Setosa**

The Iris setosa is a short, grass leaved species native to Siberia and Alaska. It is tolerant to cold temperatures and the petals are lavender blue with silvery-white veining.

**Iris Versicolor**

The Iris Versicolor is a wild flower of Eastern North America. It performs well in shallow water or by waterside but can also perform well under average border conditions.

**Iris Virginica**

The Iris Virginica also known as the Southern Blueflag is best grown in wet, boggy, acidic soils and is native to America.  It can be poisonous if ingested.

**What is the difference between Sepal and Petal?**

Sepals are recurved in such a manner to allow bees to land on them whilst petals are upright. You can see the difference in the image below. 

*"The distinctive flowers have three large outer petals called “falls” and three inner upright petals called “standards.” The falls may have beards or crests. Bearded iris are so-called because they have soft hairs along the center of the falls. In crested iris, the hairs form a comb or ridge."* - https://www.almanac.com/plant/irises

## Examples of interesting analysis pursued by others into the Fisher's Iris data set

**In this section I am looking at analysis that some people have completed on the data set. I am doing this with a view to gathering information that will form part of my analysis of the data set and also to learn from these examples.**

**https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/**

I came across this example in my online research and found it to be interesting and informative and I will draw on some of the topics and examples covered when completing my own analysis of the data set later. In this analysis they have used the pandas module to do some analysis on the data set. I liked the dataset.describe() function which printed a summary of the data set to the screen which included count of rows, mean, standard deviation, min and max. I liked this function as it gives the user a lot of insight into the data set and it is a simple operation. I will try to replicate something similar in my analysis of the data set. 


## My Analysis of the Fisher's Iris Data Set

In this section I have detailed the analysis that I carried out on the Fisher's Iris data set. I have broken down the contents of each file in my repository that has been use to analyse the data set. 

**Fishers_Iris_data_set.csv**

This file is a csv file containing the Fisher's Iris data set which I downloaded from the internet and saved in my repository. Further details in the references section of this Readme file. 

**Mean_Fisher_Iris.py**

This file contains a program that calculates the mean of the columns of data in the Fisher's Iris data set. I wrote this file using the numpy module and within the numpy module using the numpy.mean function to calculate the mean of the data in each column. I used the genfromtxt function to read the csv file and set the delimiter as comma. When I first wrote this program the output was nan (not a number) and I had to research how to skip the first row of the data set. I did this using skip_header=1. I also asked for the output to be rounded to one decimal place using the round function and I used formatted strings to return the output in a sentence. I asked for the mean of the first 4 columns of the data set to be calculated and printed as output plus a sentence informing the user about the contents of the fifth column of the data set. In writing this script I used the week 9 lectures on numpy and matplotlib as a starting point and developed the code through further research which is detailed in the references section of this Readme file. 

* How to run the program: Mean_Fisher_Iris.py:
    * Download my repository to your local machine.
    * Please note- The csv file - Fishers_Iris_data_set.csv must also be downloaded to the same folder for this program to run correctly.
    * Open cmder or command prompt and cd (change directory) to the folder where the repository has been downloaded.
    * Type python Mean_Fisher_Iris.py and the enter button.
    * The output will appear on the command line.
  
**Analysis_Data_Set.py**

I have started this script drawing on the reading of an example of an analysis into the data set that I found online at this link: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
