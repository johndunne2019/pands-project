## Programming and Scripting 2019 Project

This repository contains my project 2019 for the module Programming and Scripting at GMIT. See here for the instructions: https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-pands/raw/master/project.pdf. 

## About this Project

The project concerns the well known Fisher's Iris data set. Through completion of this project I will endeavour to do the following:

* Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it. 
* Compile a list of references used in my research. 
* Download the data set and write some python code to investigate it. 
* Write a summary of my investigations
* Include supporting graphics and tables.

Ronald Fisher was born in 1890 and died in 1962 and is widely known by the title "father of statistics". He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest statisticians ever. Despite this, Fisher was primarily a Biologist and according to the author Richard Hawkins, he was the greatest biologist since Charles Darwin. Ronald Fisher was born in London on February 17, 1890. Ronald suffered from shortsightedness and as a result was not allowed to read under an electric light. Despite this disability Ronald was widely acclaimed as a very bright student by his teachers and received scholarships for his education. in 1909, Fisher was awarded a scholarship to study mathematics as the University of Cambridge and he graduated with a first class honours in 1912.
