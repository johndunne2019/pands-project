## Programming and Scripting 2019 Project

This repository contains my project 2019 for the module Programming and Scripting at GMIT. See here for the instructions: https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-pands/raw/master/project.pdf. The project concerns the well known Fisher's Iris data set. Through completion of this project I will endeavour to do the following:

* Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it. 
* Compile a list of references used in my research. 
* Download the data set and write some python code to investigate it. 
* Write a summary of my investigations
* Include supporting graphics and tables.
